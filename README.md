# FLAME: a library for atomistic modeling environments

[FLAME](flame-code.org) is a highly modular open source software package to perform atomistic simulations using a variety of techniques.

## Installation

* FLAME requires `autoconf` and `automake` to be installed.

* It is recommended to install FLAME in a directory different from the source.

### Steps to install FLAME

* You first need to install `futile` which is
a set of utilities from the [BigDFT](http://bigdft.org) suite.
It is highly recommended to use the tar file of futile given inside the
FLAME to avoid possible inconsistency.

* You do NOT need different installation of futile
for multiple installations of FLAME.

#### Here are steps:

1. `Untar` the futile inside the FLAME, then in order to build futile,
make a directory somewhere and from there run the following:

   - `path_to_futile_source/Installer.py build futile -c "FCFLAGS=-O2" 
     "--with-ext-linalg=-L/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.2.146/mkl/lib/intel64
     -lmkl_rt -lmkl_scalapack_lp64 -lmkl_blacs_openmpi_lp64 -liomp5 -lm"
     "CC=mpicc" "CXX=mpicxx" "FC=mpif90" "F77=mpif90" "FCLIBS= "`

   - Of course, the setting is given for a particular version and
installation of `MKL`, you must need to modify it according to your machine.

   - After installation, you may need to find out how to link with
the build futile, however, in the subsequent steps you see an
example. In case, you want to know how to link you can run:

   - `path_to_futile_source/Installer.py link futile`

2. in FLAME source directory run:

   - `autoreconf -fi`

3. make a directory to build flame and then replace `$FUTILE` by the
full path of futile built directory or define it as an environment variable:

   - `export FUTILE=path_to_built_futile_directory`

   - IMPORTANT: exporting FUTILE variable is required, not optional.

4. `path_to_flame_source/configure FC=mpif90 F77=mpif90 CXX=mpicc CC=mpicc 
FCFLAGS="-I$FUTILE/install/include -shared-intel -mcmodel=large  -mkl=sequential" 
CFLAGS=-mcmodel=large "LIBS=-L$FUTILE/install/lib 
-L/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.2.146/mkl/lib/intel64 -lfutile-1 -lmkl_rt 
-lmkl_scalapack_lp64 -lmkl_blacs_openmpi_lp64 -liomp5 -lm -lyaml -ldl -lrt -cxxlib"`

   Linking to exterior packages:

   - if you want to link with [SPGLIB](https://atztogo.github.io/spglib/) then add

     `--with-spglib SPGLIB_ROOT=path_to_spglib`

   - if you want to link with [BigDFT](http://bigdft.org) PSolver then add

     `--with-bps BDIR=path_to_bigdft_root`

   - if you want to link with [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov) then add

     `--with-lammps LAMMPS_ROOT=path_to_lammps_root`

4. `make`

   You should be ready to use FLAME, the executable is at `src/flame`
